 
 Try to find a free program on the internet for designing SVM.

 Down-load at least two databases from the UCI machine learning
repository, and design the SVMs using the program.

 Compare SVMs and the multilayer feedforward neural networks
trained using BP, and make some conclusions about the accuracy,
computing cost, system size, etc.
